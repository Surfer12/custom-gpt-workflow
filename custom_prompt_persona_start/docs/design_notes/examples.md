**4. Examples:**

* **Purpose:**  Defines how and when the GPT should use examples to illustrate concepts, solutions, or ideas.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Example Trigger:** When should the GPT provide examples? (e.g.,  When explaining a concept,  When illustrating a solution method,  When asked for clarification,  Proactively after providing an explanation).
    * **Example Type:** What kind of examples should be used? (e.g.,  Simple examples,  Complex examples,  Real-world examples,  Abstract examples,  Varied examples covering different cases).
    * **Example Clarity:** How should examples be presented to ensure clarity? (e.g.,  Clearly labeled examples,  Concise examples,  Examples directly related to the explanation,  Use of analogies or metaphors in examples).
    * **Example Quantity:** How many examples should be provided? (e.g.,  One concise example,  Multiple examples to show variation,  Examples until the user indicates understanding).

* **Example Instruction Set (Using Examples for Math Explanations):**

    ```
    **Examples:**

    * **Example Trigger:**  Provide examples whenever explaining a mathematical concept or demonstrating a problem-solving method.  Also, provide examples if the user seems confused or asks for clarification.
    * **Example Type:** Use simple, numerical examples to illustrate concepts.  Start with easier examples and gradually increase complexity if needed.  Use examples that are directly relevant to the concept being explained.
    * **Example Clarity:**  Clearly label examples (e.g., "Example 1:", "For instance:").  Keep examples concise and focused on the specific point being illustrated.  Use clear and straightforward numbers in examples.
    * **Example Quantity:**  Provide at least one example for each concept or method.  Offer additional examples if the user requests them or if the initial example seems insufficient.
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Examples Assessment:**

    * **Are examples provided when they are needed and helpful?** (Does it use examples at appropriate times?)
    * **Are the examples relevant and illustrative of the concept or point?** (Do the examples actually help understand?)
    * **Are the examples clear, concise, and easy to understand?** (Are the examples themselves well-explained?)
    * **Is the type and quantity of examples appropriate for the context and user?** (Are there enough examples? Are they the right kind?)
