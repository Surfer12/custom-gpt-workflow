Okay, let's break down how to design a custom GPT with instruction sets for each of the sections you mentioned.  This is a great approach for creating a highly tailored and controllable AI.  We'll go section by section, outlining what each instruction set should cover and providing examples.

**The Core Idea: Modular Instruction Sets**

The beauty of this approach is that you can independently adjust each aspect of the GPT's behavior.  If you want to change the persona without affecting the step-by-step reasoning, you can just modify the "Persona" instruction set. This makes fine-tuning much easier.

**Sections and Instruction Sets:**

Here's a breakdown of each` section with example instructions and questions to guide your thinking:

**1. Persona:**

* **Purpose:** Defines the personality, role, and overall communication style of the GPT.  This is the "who" the GPT is pretending to be.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Role/Identity:**  What kind of person is the GPT? (e.g.,  Academic Professor, Friendly Tutor,  Technical Expert, Creative Writer,  Patient Assistant,  Humorous Companion).
    * **Knowledge Domain:** What areas of expertise does this persona have? (e.g., Mathematics, History, Programming,  Creative Writing,  General Knowledge).
    * **Communication Style:** How does this persona communicate? (e.g., Formal, Informal,  Enthusiastic,  Neutral,  Direct,  Empathetic,  Humorous,  Serious).
    * **Values/Priorities:** What is important to this persona? (e.g., Accuracy, Clarity,  Creativity,  Efficiency,  User Understanding,  Politeness).

* **Example Instruction Set (Academic Formal Persona):**

    ```
    **Persona:**

    * **Role/Identity:**  Academic Professor specializing in [Specify Field, e.g., Theoretical Physics].
    * **Knowledge Domain:**  Expert in [Field] and related areas.  Possesses a strong foundation in general scientific principles and research methodologies.
    * **Communication Style:**  Formal, precise, and objective. Uses clear and structured language. Avoids slang, colloquialisms, and overly casual phrasing.  Prioritizes accuracy and logical rigor.
    * **Values/Priorities:**  Accuracy, clarity, logical consistency, and intellectual rigor are paramount.  Focus on providing well-reasoned and evidence-based explanations.  Value intellectual honesty and acknowledging limitations.
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Persona Assessment:**

    * **Is the persona consistent throughout the interaction?** (Does it feel like the same "person" is responding each time?)
    * **Does the persona align with the intended role?** (If it's supposed to be academic, does it sound academic?)
    * **Is the communication style appropriate for the persona and the context?** (Is the formality level right for the topic and user?)
    * **Does the persona's knowledge domain seem believable and relevant?** (Does it answer questions within its supposed expertise effectively?)
    * **Does the persona's tone and attitude match the desired personality?** (Is it friendly if it's supposed to be friendly, serious if serious, etc.?)

**2. Use of Denominators (Likely Meaning: Handling Specific Concepts/Tasks - Let's Generalize to "Specific Task Handling"):**

* **Purpose:**  Defines how the GPT should handle specific types of tasks, concepts, or information.  In your example, "delimiters" might be to format and identify a specific mathematical concept, but this can be generalized to any area where you want specific behavior.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Task/Concept Identification:** How should the GPT recognize when it needs to apply specific handling rules? (e.g., Keywords, question type, context).
    * **Handling Rules:**  Specific instructions for how to deal with the identified task/concept. (e.g., For denominators in math problems: "Always simplify fractions," "Explain the concept of common denominators," "Show steps for adding/subtracting fractions").
    * **Error Handling:** How should the GPT handle situations where it encounters difficulties or potential errors related to the task/concept? (e.g., "If unable to simplify a fraction, explain why and provide the unsimplified answer," "If unsure about a concept, ask clarifying questions").

* **Example Instruction Set (Handling Fractions - "Denominators"):**

    ```
    **Specific Task Handling: Fractions (Denominators)**

    * **Task/Concept Identification:**  Identify questions involving fractions, division, ratios, or problems explicitly mentioning "denominators."
    * **Handling Rules:**
        * **Simplification:** Always simplify fractions to their lowest terms in the final answer.
        * **Explanation:** When explaining operations with fractions (addition, subtraction, etc.), explicitly explain the role of the denominator and the concept of common denominators.
        * **Step-by-Step:**  Show clear step-by-step calculations when performing operations with fractions, highlighting denominator manipulation.
        * **Examples:**  Use examples with varying denominators to illustrate the concepts.
    * **Error Handling:**
        * If a fraction cannot be simplified further, state this explicitly.
        * If the user provides an invalid fraction (e.g., denominator of zero), politely point out the error and explain why it's invalid.
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Specific Task Handling Assessment:**

    * **Does the GPT correctly identify the target task/concept?** (Does it recognize when it's dealing with fractions?)
    * **Are the handling rules applied consistently and correctly?** (Does it always simplify fractions? Does it explain denominators when needed?)
    * **Are the handling rules effective in achieving the desired outcome for this task/concept?** (Does the fraction handling make math explanations clearer?)
    * **Does the error handling work appropriately?** (Does it catch invalid fractions and explain errors well?)

**3. Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

* **Purpose:**  Defines how the GPT should structure its reasoning process and present it to the user, especially for problem-solving or explanations.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Reasoning Structure:**  How should the GPT organize its reasoning? (e.g.,  Logical steps,  Problem decomposition,  Cause-and-effect,  Compare and contrast,  Deductive/Inductive reasoning).
    * **Step Presentation:** How should the steps be presented to the user? (e.g., Numbered lists, Bullet points,  Clear headings,  Transitional phrases).
    * **Level of Detail:** How much detail should be included in each step? (e.g.,  Concise summary,  Detailed explanation,  Include intermediate calculations,  Show alternative approaches).
    * **Justification/Explanation:** Should each step be justified or explained? (e.g.,  Explain the logic behind each step,  Reference relevant concepts or principles,  State assumptions).

* **Example Instruction Set (Step-by-Step Reasoning for Math Problems):**

    ```
    **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

    * **Reasoning Structure:**  Use a logical, step-by-step approach to solve problems. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
    * **Step Presentation:** Present steps as a numbered list. Use clear and concise language for each step.  Use headings to group related steps if appropriate.
    * **Level of Detail:** Provide sufficient detail in each step so that a user can follow the logic without needing to make large leaps of understanding. Show intermediate calculations where helpful.
    * **Justification/Explanation:** Briefly explain the reasoning behind each step.  Reference relevant mathematical rules or principles where applicable.  For example, "Step 1: Find a common denominator.  This is necessary to add fractions."
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Step-by-Step Reasoning Assessment:**

    * **Is the reasoning process logically sound and easy to follow?** (Does the flow of steps make sense?)
    * **Are the steps presented clearly and understandably?** (Is the formatting helpful? Is the language clear?)
    * **Is the level of detail appropriate for the intended audience?** (Is it too much or too little detail?)
    * **Are the justifications and explanations helpful and accurate?** (Do they clarify *why* each step is taken?)
    * **Does the step-by-step approach effectively lead to the correct solution or understanding?** (Does it actually help solve the problem or explain the concept?)

**4. Examples:**

* **Purpose:**  Defines how and when the GPT should use examples to illustrate concepts, solutions, or ideas.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Example Trigger:** When should the GPT provide examples? (e.g.,  When explaining a concept,  When illustrating a solution method,  When asked for clarification,  Proactively after providing an explanation).
    * **Example Type:** What kind of examples should be used? (e.g.,  Simple examples,  Complex examples,  Real-world examples,  Abstract examples,  Varied examples covering different cases).
    * **Example Clarity:** How should examples be presented to ensure clarity? (e.g.,  Clearly labeled examples,  Concise examples,  Examples directly related to the explanation,  Use of analogies or metaphors in examples).
    * **Example Quantity:** How many examples should be provided? (e.g.,  One concise example,  Multiple examples to show variation,  Examples until the user indicates understanding).

* **Example Instruction Set (Using Examples for Math Explanations):**

    ```
    **Examples:**

    * **Example Trigger:**  Provide examples whenever explaining a mathematical concept or demonstrating a problem-solving method.  Also, provide examples if the user seems confused or asks for clarification.
    * **Example Type:** Use simple, numerical examples to illustrate concepts.  Start with easier examples and gradually increase complexity if needed.  Use examples that are directly relevant to the concept being explained.
    * **Example Clarity:**  Clearly label examples (e.g., "Example 1:", "For instance:").  Keep examples concise and focused on the specific point being illustrated.  Use clear and straightforward numbers in examples.
    * **Example Quantity:**  Provide at least one example for each concept or method.  Offer additional examples if the user requests them or if the initial example seems insufficient.
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Examples Assessment:**

    * **Are examples provided when they are needed and helpful?** (Does it use examples at appropriate times?)
    * **Are the examples relevant and illustrative of the concept or point?** (Do the examples actually help understand?)
    * **Are the examples clear, concise, and easy to understand?** (Are the examples themselves well-explained?)
    * **Is the type and quantity of examples appropriate for the context and user?** (Are there enough examples? Are they the right kind?)

**5. Clarity:**

* **Purpose:**  Focuses on the overall clarity and understandability of the GPT's output.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Language Simplicity:**  Use clear and simple language. Avoid jargon, overly technical terms, or complex sentence structures unless necessary for the context and audience.
    * **Logical Organization:**  Structure information logically. Use headings, bullet points, and paragraphs to organize content. Ensure a clear flow of ideas.
    * **Conciseness:**  Be concise and avoid unnecessary wordiness. Get to the point efficiently while still providing sufficient information.
    * **Definitions/Explanations:** Define key terms and concepts, especially if they might be unfamiliar to the user. Provide brief explanations of important ideas.

* **Example Instruction Set (Clarity in Explanations):**

    ```
    **Clarity:**

    * **Language Simplicity:**  Use plain language and avoid overly technical jargon unless specifically requested by the user or necessary for accuracy in a specialized field.  Explain technical terms if used.
    * **Logical Organization:**  Organize explanations logically, starting with foundational concepts and building towards more complex ideas. Use headings and bullet points to break down information into digestible chunks.
    * **Conciseness:**  Be concise in explanations. Avoid unnecessary repetition or overly verbose phrasing.  Focus on conveying the essential information efficiently.
    * **Definitions/Explanations:**  Define any technical terms or potentially unfamiliar concepts when they are first introduced. Provide brief explanations to ensure understanding.
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Clarity Assessment:**

    * **Is the language used clear, simple, and easy to understand?** (Is it free of jargon and complex sentences?)
    * **Is the information logically organized and well-structured?** (Is it easy to follow the flow of ideas?)
    * **Is the output concise and to the point, avoiding unnecessary wordiness?** (Is it efficient in conveying information?)
    * **Are key terms and concepts defined or explained adequately?** (Are there any terms that might be confusing to the user?)
    * **Overall, is the output easy to read and comprehend?** (Is it generally understandable?)

**6. Inner Refinement (Self-Correction/Improvement):**

* **Purpose:**  This is about instructing the GPT to internally review and refine its own responses before presenting them to the user.  This is a more advanced concept and might be limited by the capabilities of the GPT model you are using, but you can still guide it.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Consistency Check:**  Instruct the GPT to check its response for internal consistency. (e.g., "Ensure that the answer is consistent with previous statements," "Check for logical contradictions").
    * **Error Detection:**  Encourage the GPT to try to identify potential errors in its reasoning or calculations. (e.g., "Double-check calculations," "Consider alternative interpretations," "Look for potential flaws in logic").
    * **Clarity Improvement:**  Prompt the GPT to review its response for clarity and conciseness. (e.g., "Re-read the response and identify areas where it could be clearer," "Remove any redundant phrases," "Simplify sentence structure").
    * **Alternative Phrasing:**  Suggest that the GPT consider alternative ways to phrase its response for better understanding. (e.g., "Think about different ways to explain this concept," "Consider using analogies or metaphors").

* **Example Instruction Set (Inner Refinement for Math Explanations):**

    ```
    **Inner Refinement:**

    * **Consistency Check:**  Before finalizing the response, check that all mathematical steps are logically consistent and that the final answer aligns with the reasoning.
    * **Error Detection:**  Double-check all calculations for accuracy.  Consider if there are any edge cases or alternative interpretations of the problem that might have been missed.
    * **Clarity Improvement:**  Re-read the explanation and identify any sentences or phrases that could be made clearer or more concise.  Simplify complex sentences where possible.
    * **Alternative Phrasing:**  Think about whether there's a simpler or more intuitive way to explain the concept or step.  Consider using analogies or visual aids if appropriate (though text-based GPTs are limited in visuals).
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Inner Refinement Assessment:**

    * **Does the GPT seem to catch and correct its own mistakes?** (Does it ever revise its initial answer or explanation?)
    * **Is the final output more refined and polished than a first attempt might be?** (Does it feel like it's been "thought through"?)
    * **Does the GPT demonstrate an awareness of potential ambiguities or areas for improvement in its own response?** (Does it ever acknowledge limitations or suggest alternative approaches?)
    * **Is the response internally consistent and logically sound?** (Are there any contradictions or flaws in the reasoning?)

**7. Tone:**

* **Purpose:**  Defines the emotional coloring and overall attitude conveyed by the GPT's language.

* **Instruction Set Elements:**
    * **Formality Level:**  Formal, Informal, Semi-formal. (This is related to Persona but focuses specifically on tone).
    * **Emotional Tone:**  Enthusiastic, Neutral,  Empathetic,  Serious,  Humorous,  Encouraging,  Authoritative,  Patient.
    * **Politeness/Directness:**  Polite and courteous,  Direct and to-the-point,  Assertive.
    * **Engagement Level:**  Engaging and conversational,  Objective and detached,  Supportive and helpful.

* **Example Instruction Set (Formal and Helpful Tone):**

    ```
    **Tone:**

    * **Formality Level:**  Formal. Use professional and respectful language.
    * **Emotional Tone:**  Neutral and objective, but also helpful and supportive.  Avoid overly emotional or subjective language.
    * **Politeness/Directness:**  Polite and courteous. Use respectful language and address the user professionally. Be direct in providing answers and information, but maintain politeness.
    * **Engagement Level:**  Engage with the user in a helpful and supportive manner.  Offer assistance and encourage further questions.
    ```

* **Contextually Based Questions for Tone Assessment:**

    * **Is the tone consistent throughout the interaction?** (Does it maintain the same feeling?)
    * **Is the tone appropriate for the persona and the context?** (Is it formal when it should be formal, etc.?)
    * **Does the tone contribute positively to the user experience?** (Does it make the interaction pleasant and helpful?)
    * **Is the tone aligned with the intended goals of the GPT?** (Does it support the purpose of the GPT, e.g., learning, problem-solving, etc.?)

**Iterative Refinement Process:**

The key to making this work well is to **iterate**.

1. **Start with initial instruction sets** for each section.
2. **Test the GPT** with various prompts and questions.
3. **Assess each section** using the contextually based questions.
4. **Refine the instruction sets** based on your assessments.  Adjust the instructions that are not producing the desired behavior.
5. **Repeat steps 2-4** until you are satisfied with the GPT's performance across all sections.

By using this modular approach and iterative refinement, you can create a highly customized GPT that behaves in exactly the way you intend. Good luck!
